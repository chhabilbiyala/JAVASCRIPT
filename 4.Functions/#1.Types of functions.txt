functions are indeed a central and powerful feature of JavaScript, and their flexibility allows for elegant and expressive coding.

1) FUNCTION STATEMENT/DECLARATION:- A function statement or declaration in JavaScript is used to define a named function.

function functionName(parameters) {
    // Function body
    // Code to be executed
    return value; // Optional
}
---------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------
2) FUNCTION EXPRESSIONS (Assigning Functions to Variables) : In a function expression, when you assign a function to a variable, it is called an anonymous function expression if the function itself doesn't have a name. If you do give the function a name, it becomes a named function expression. Here's an example:
a) Anonymous Function Expression:

const myFunction = function() {
    console.log("This is an anonymous function expression.");
};

myFunction(); // Calling the anonymous function

b) Named Function Expression:

const namedFunction = function myNamedFunction() {
    console.log("This is a named function expression.");
};

namedFunction(); // Calling the named function expression
// myNamedFunction(); // This would result in an error since the name is not accessible outside the function expression
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Difference between fuynction declaration and function expression

1) Hoisting Behavior:
   a) Function Declaration: Function declarations are hoisted to the top of their containing scope during the compilation phase, which means you can call the function before its actual declaration in the code.
   b) Function Expression: Function expressions are not hoisted. They must be defined before they are used, otherwise you'll encounter a reference error.

2) Anonymous vs Named Functions:
   a) Function Declaration: Function declarations require a name for the function. The name is mandatory and is used to refer to the function itself.
   b) Function Expression: Function expressions can be either anonymous (without a name) or named. Named function expressions can be useful for debugging purposes as they provide a name in stack traces.

3) Assignment and Usage:
   a) Function Declaration: The entire function declaration is a statement, and it's used as a standalone construct. You can't assign a function declaration to a variable or pass it as an argument.
   b) Function Expression: Function expressions are often assigned to variables or used as arguments for other functions. They can be treated as values and passed around in your code.
   Ex:-  In JavaScript, you can pass a function as a parameter to another function only when using a function expression. This is because function expressions create function values that can be treated like any other values, including being passed as arguments to other functions. Function declarations, on the other hand, are statements and do not directly produce function values that can be passed as arguments.

   const add = function(a, b) {
    return a + b;
   };

   const operate = function(operation, x, y) {
    return operation(x, y);
   };

   const result = operate(add, 5, 3); // Pass the "add" function as an argument
   console.log(result); // Outputs: 8

4) Scope and Temporal Dead Zone:
   a) Function Declaration: Due to hoisting, function declarations are available throughout the entire scope in which they are declared, even before their actual declaration.
   b) Function Expression: Function expressions have a temporal dead zone before their declaration. This means they can't be accessed or called before they are defined.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3) FIRST CLASS FUNCTION (They are first class citizens):- The concept of being able to treat functions as values, pass them as arguments to other functions, and return functions from functions is known as "first-class functions."  functions are treated like any other data type, such as numbers or strings.

// Function that takes another function as an argument
function operate(a, b, operation) {
    return operation(a, b);
}

// Functions that can be passed as arguments
function add(x, y) {
    return x + y;
}

function subtract(x, y) {
    return x - y;
}

function multiply(x, y) {
    return x * y;
}

function divide(x, y) {
    return x / y;
}

// Using first-class functions to perform operations
console.log(operate(5, 3, add));      // Outputs: 8 (5 + 3)
console.log(operate(10, 4, subtract)); // Outputs: 6 (10 - 4)
console.log(operate(6, 7, multiply)); // Outputs: 42 (6 * 7)
console.log(operate(15, 3, divide));  // Outputs: 5 (15 / 3)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
4) ARROW FUNCTION:- Arrow functions are a concise way to write functions in JavaScript introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6). They provide a shorter syntax compared to traditional function expressions, and they also have some unique features.

const myFunction = (param1, param2) => {
  // Function body
  return result;
};

Key Features and Advantages of Arrow Functions:
1) Concise Syntax:
Arrow functions have a shorter syntax compared to regular function expressions, which can make code cleaner and easier to read.
----------------------------
2) No this Binding:
Arrow functions do not have their own this context. Instead, they inherit the this value from the surrounding code. This can help avoid certain context-related bugs and confusion.

const person = {
  name: "Alice",
  greet: function() {
    console.log("Hello, " + this.name); // Regular function binds its own 'this'
  },
  greetArrow: () => {
    console.log("Hello, " + this.name); // Arrow function inherits 'this' from surrounding context
  }
};

person.greet();      // Output: Hello, Alice
person.greetArrow(); // Output: Hello, undefined (or some other value depending on the surrounding context)
----------------------------
3) Implicit Return:
If an arrow function's body consists of a single expression, the curly braces {} and the return keyword can be omitted. The result of the expression will be implicitly returned.

// Regular function with explicit return
const double = function(num) {
  return num * 2;
};

// Arrow function with implicit return
const doubleArrow = num => num * 2;
---------------------------------
4) Single Parameter Parentheses Omission:
If a function takes only one parameter, you can omit the parentheses around the parameter list.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5) IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression):- An IIFE is a design pattern in JavaScript that involves defining and executing a function immediately after its creation. It encapsulates code within its own private scope, helping to avoid variable collisions and polluting the global namespace. IIFE is often used to create a local scope for a block of code and is a way to achieve module-like behavior before the introduction of native modules in modern JavaScript (ES6).

Syntax of IIFE:

(function() {
  // Code enclosed within the IIFE
})();

Why Use IIFE:
a) Encapsulation: IIFE helps create a private scope for the enclosed code. Variables and functions declared inside the IIFE are not accessible from outside, preventing potential naming conflicts or accidental modifications.
b) Avoiding Global Pollution: Without IIFE, variables declared within a function can become global variables if not properly managed. IIFE ensures that variables stay within their own scope.
c) Modularity: IIFE allows you to organize your code into modules or chunks, making it easier to manage and maintain. Each IIFE can encapsulate a specific piece of functionality.
d) Code Isolation: When you want to execute a piece of code immediately without polluting the global scope, IIFE provides a convenient way to do so.
In essence, an IIFE is a way to create a controlled and isolated environment for a block of code, making your codebase more organized, modular, and less prone to unexpected issues caused by variable conflicts.

6) CALLBACK FUNCTION:- JavaScript is inherently single-threaded and synchronous in nature, meaning it executes one operation at a time in a sequential manner. However, with the use of callback functions and various asynchronous mechanisms, JavaScript can achieve asynchronous behavior, allowing it to handle tasks concurrently without blocking the main execution thread.
Callback Functions: A callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is intended to be executed at a later time, often after an asynchronous operation completes. Callbacks are a fundamental way to achieve asynchronous behavior in JavaScript.
Non-blocking Operations: Asynchronous operations (like reading files, making network requests, or handling user input) can be initiated and run in the background without blocking the main execution thread. When these operations complete, their associated callback functions are placed in the task queue for execution.
Asynchronous Functions and APIs: JavaScript provides asynchronous functions and APIs, like setTimeout, setInterval, and AJAX requests, that allow you to schedule tasks to be executed in the future or in response to external events. These functions don't block the main thread while waiting for the task to complete.

Blocking of Main Thread (Call Stack): In JavaScript, the main thread (also referred to as the call stack) is where your code is executed sequentially. If a function takes a considerable amount of time to complete its execution, it can "block" the main thread. During this time, the main thread is occupied with executing that function, and other code execution, user interactions, and events are delayed or blocked. This can lead to unresponsive user interfaces, slow performance, and a poor user experience.

Asynchronous Execution and Callbacks: To prevent the blocking of the main thread and maintain a responsive user interface, JavaScript uses asynchronous execution. Asynchronous operations, like network requests or reading files, are performed outside the main thread. Callback functions are used to handle the results of these asynchronous operations. By providing a callback, you can specify what should happen once the asynchronous task is completed, without waiting for it to finish. This allows the main thread to continue executing other tasks while waiting for the asynchronous operation to complete.

The term "callback function" is used in the context of asynchronous programming, where a function is passed as an argument to another function and is intended to be called at a later time, often after some asynchronous operation completes.

setTimeout(function() {
  console.log("timer");
}, 5000);

function x(y) {
  console.log("hey x");
  y();
}

x(function y() {
  console.log("hey y");
});

In this example, y is a callback function because it is being passed as an argument to the function x, and x is designed to call this function later, if function y taking any considerable amount of time, and js engine will carry out the function asynchronically.

Here are some common callback functions in JavaScript:

setTimeout(): Executes a function after a specified delay.
setInterval(): Repeatedly executes a function with a fixed time delay between each execution.
addEventListener(): Registers a function to be called when a specific event occurs on a DOM element.
fetch(): Performs asynchronous network requests and provides a callback for handling the response.
Promise.then(): Registers a callback to be executed when a Promise resolves.
Array.prototype.forEach(): Executes a provided function once for each array element.
Array.prototype.map(): Creates a new array by calling a provided function on each element of the original array.
Array.prototype.filter(): Creates a new array with all elements that pass a test implemented by the provided function.
Array.prototype.reduce(): Applies a function against an accumulator and each element in the array (from left to right) to reduce it to a single value.
XMLHttpRequest.onreadystatechange: A callback function for handling different states of an XMLHttpRequest object.
